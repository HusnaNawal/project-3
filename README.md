# project-3

This is my HOT ( Hand-on-test) for my object oriented programming subject. So the test required me to create a database in mysql (Xampp) by using my student id as my database name.
Then, I was required to create a table suing my student id + users and there were 4 columns in it which are id, name, gender and age. Next, i was required to insert data into the table and retrieve the data.
The code was developed in JAVA using Netbean.
